# About Me

I am a 20 year old software developer (when I have the time) based in Florida.
Most often I am contributing to the
[FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) community.
I even help maintain a few projects myself, like
[NixOS/nixpkgs](https://nixos.org) and [Prism
Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org).

You might be most interested in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/getchoo).

Nowadays I'm primarily focusing on:

- Modern Linux app deployment tools

    - [Nix](https://nix.dev)
    - [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org)
    - [AppImage](https://appimage.org)
    - [Containers](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers)

- [Reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/)
- [Free software supply chain security](https://project.linuxfoundation.org/hubfs/Reports/oss_supply_chain_security.pdf?hsLang=en)
- A lot of things [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)
- Some web stuff, like [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), and [Astro](https://astro.build) (this site is made with the last one BTW)
