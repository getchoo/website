# About Me

I am a 20 year old software developer (when I have the time) based in Florida.
Most commonly, I am contributing to the
[FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) community
-- specifically for projects like [NixOS and nixpkgs](https://nixos.org),
[Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org), and whatever else I find fun
and/or personally use.

Some technologies I play around with the most include the aforementioned
[Nix](https://nix.dev), [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions),
[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (usually in slightly horrifying
ways), [Deno](https://deno.com/), [Cloudflare
Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/),
[FastAPI](https://www.python.org/), and [Astro](https://astro.build) (which
this site is made with!)
